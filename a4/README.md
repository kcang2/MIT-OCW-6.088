4.1 The client does not have access to the nodes of the tree. They can only manipulate via interfaces such as print, insert and find.

4.2 Representation Invariant of BST is that for every node, the values of the nodes on the left subtree is less than its value whereas the values of the nodes on the right subtree is greater than its value. Nothing needs to be done as the code written is correct.

4.3 Tested duplicate insertion, finding non-existant elements and printing out the tree to see if outputs are as expected.
